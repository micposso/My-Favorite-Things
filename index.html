  <p>A taco is a traditional Mexican dish composed of a corn or wheat <em>tortilla</em> folded or rolled around a filling. The filling can vary widely and includes ingredients such as <strong>beef, pork, chicken, seafood, beans, vegetables, and cheese</strong>, allowing for great versatility and variety. Tacos are often garnished with various condiments, such as salsa, guacamole, or sour cream, and topped with diced vegetables like <mark>onions and cilantro</mark>. They are typically eaten without utensils and are known for their flavorful combinations and convenient hand-held form.</p>
